# What's this?

The default `dotnet new` blazor templates shipped with dotnet sdk is fine, there are just some tiny annoying things make me feel uncomfortable, like:

1. bootstrap & jQuery are always included
2. the default pages and layouts will always be deleted eventually
3. since .NET 6, `implicit using` was enabled as default.
4. since .NET 6, no `Program` class & `Main` function anymore

Actually these changes are not big deals, just I don't like it, so I've decided to create `ZhangShaobo.Templates` to fix these annoying things:

1. `implicit using` disabled
2. `Program` class and `Main` function as the old way
3. no default pages(well, the default `Index` still had to be there)
4. no external front-end web libraries involved: like jQuery & bootstrap
5. add scripts like `Build.ps1`, `Clean.ps1` and `Start.ps1` etc. for convenience.
   and as you can see from the script suffix: these are PowerShell scripts, **they should also works fine on Powershell of non-windows platform.**

You might wonder what the fuck is `ZhangShaobo` & `Shaobo`, well, I have to confess that I didn't thought too much when I started, the biggest mistake I've made and realized so far is to use my real name as the `nupkg` package name and template name: 

1. it made the package name and template name too long..ðŸ˜’
2. I should not mark my name to such a toy project, I should made something that change the world, not this piece of crap. It's harmful to my reputation..ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’
3. #2 is a joke: actually I'm proud of every piece of crap I've made: the world is made up of craps, all craps matters! ðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ªðŸ¤ª

# Templates

## 1. Blazor WASM application : `shaobo_wasm`, `shaobo_wasm_antd`, `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut`

these three templates are all similiar to the official `dotnet new blazorwasm --hosted` template, this template will create a `Solution` contains multiple `Projects`:

   `shaobo_wasm` and `shaobo_wasm_antd` will create three projects just like the `dotnet new blazorwasm --hosted` : `xx.Client`, `xx.Server` and `xx.Shared`. `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut` will create an extra unit test project `xx.Test`

1. `shaobo_wasm` is the most simple, clean one : just nothing except a default page: no controllers, no layout components, no webapi, nothing.

2. `shaobo_wasm_antd` added Antdesign UI library based on `shaobo_wasm`.

3. `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut` added unit test suites(xUnit & coverlet) based on `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut`

### Parameters & Usage:

all those templates shares the same usage and parameter definitions

|Parameter|Default Value|Options|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|`__PROJECT_NAME__`|`HelloBlazorWASM`|`-o`, `--output`|the project name|
|`__DEV_HTTP_PORT__`|5018|`-H`, `--HttpDevPort` |HTTP Port number in development env|
|`__DEV_HTTPS_PORT__`|7284|`-Ht`, `--HttpsDevPort` | HTTPs Port number in development env|

examples:

```powershell
dotnet new shaobo_wasm -o MyFirstWASMApp -H 5000 -Ht 5001
```

### Helper Scripts:

|Script name| Parameters| Description|
|--|--|--|
|`Build.ps1`|--|build & restore the whole solution, include `Client` & `Server` and `Shared`, and `Test` as well if it exist|
|`Clean.ps1`|--|delete all the intermidiate files & folders generated by build or test procedure|
|`Start.ps1`|--|start the local development server in watch(hot reload enabled) mode|
|`Test.ps1`|--|**only available for `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut`** : execute unit tests and generate readable cc report|

### Notes:

1. `${__PROJECT_NAME__}.Shared\BlankModel.cs` is a blank class definition. I have to place at least one class definition in the `Shared` project otherwise statement `using ${__PROJECT_NAME__}.Shared` will be treat as a compile error in `Client` & `Server` project
2. `${__PROJECT_NAME__}.Shared` is just a regular class library, it's not Blazor Component Library, so don't put any shared Blazor Components or statis assets into it

## 2. Blazor Server application : `shaobo_blazor`

similar with the official `dotnet new blazorserver`, this template will create a single project instead of a solution with project(s).

### Parameters & Usage:

|Parameter|Default Value|Options|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|`__PROJECT_NAME__`|`HelloBlazorServer`|`-o`, `--output`|the project name|
|`__DEV_HTTP_PORT__`|3037|`-H`, `--HttpDevPort` |HTTP Port number in development env|
|`__DEV_HTTPS_PORT__`|6428|`-Ht`, `--HttpsDevPort` | HTTPs Port number in development env|

examples:

```powershell
dotnet new shaobo_blazor -o MyFirstBlazorServerApp -H 5000 -Ht 5001
```

### Helper Scripts:

|Script name| Parameters| Description|
|--|--|--|
|`Clean.ps1`|--|delete all the intermidiate files & folders generated by build procedure|

# release note (order by release time ASC)

## 1.0.5, 2023-03-31

1. migrate to net7.0

2. set `*.Server.csproj` as the default start up project for blazor wasm templates

3. bug fix: blazor wasm templates use hard coded GUID as solution & project GUID in `sln` file

   now the templates will generate solution GUID & project GUID dynamically

## 1.0.6, 2023-03-31

1. add template `shaobo_wasm_antd_ut`

2. make `README.md` cleaner

## 1.0.7, 2023-04-01

1. add `Test.ps1` helper script for `shaobo_wasm_ant_ut`: execute UT & generate CC report

## 1.0.8, 2023-04-01

1. bug fix: for blazor wasm templates, css isolation doesn't work

2. make `README.md` cleaner

## 1.0.9, 2023-04-03
